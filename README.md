# AI4LAM Metadata Working Group
## Meetings, Projects, and Notebooks
The [AI4LAM][AI4LAM] Metadata Working Group [Jupyter][JBBK] Book contains
meeting notes, projects and [Jupyter][JB] notebooks. 

From our [charter][CHARTER]:

> The Metadata Working Group will explore and share the ways in which AI  
> technologies can be applied to the creation and enhancement of metadata 
> for cultural heritage resources. It will also address the role of 
> metadata in collecting, curating, and describing the resources needed 
> for AI, machine learning, and data science more broadly.

Jupyter Notebooks, data, and associated source code for interactive sessions in the [AI4LAM][AI4LAM] Metadata Working Group's monthly meeting.
